## Speakers

### Call for proposals

We are now accepting submissions for presentations. The Call for Proposals will end on September 24th.

We'd love to hear your ideas for talks on the many and varied aspects of JavaScript and Node.js. Our favorite topics are those that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world experience and research. Come share with us!

Go ahead, suggest a speaker or submit a talk!
